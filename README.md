Steal My Focus - Gnome Shell Extension
======================================

Let windows steal focus. Removes the annoying 'Window is ready'
notification and focus window immediately.

You can also specify a blacklist for annoying applications (eg. Skype).

Installation
------------

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dylanwinn/gnome-shell-extension-stealmyfocus.git ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/steal-my-focus@kagesenshi.org
```

Note that the directory *must* be named steal-my-focus@kagesenshi.org. With that done, either logout or hit Alt+F2 and enter the command "r" to reload your extensions. You can enable Steal My Focus using gnome-tweak-tool or on https://extensions.gnome.org/local/.
